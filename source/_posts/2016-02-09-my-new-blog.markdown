Now that I have this shiny new blog setup, here's where I will be continuing (albeit after more than 2 years) writing about my explorations. 
My [older blogspot blog](http://kmmankad.blogspot.com) will stay on though.

Here are some links on setting up [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) that I found useful:

* [Paul Sturgess's Hello Octopress & Github Pages](http://paulsturgess.co.uk/blog/2013/04/24/hello-octopress-and-github-pages/)
* [Kornelije Sajler's Guide On Deploying Octopress](http://learnaholic.me/2012/10/10/deploying-octopress-to-github-pages-and-setting-custom-subdomain-cname/)

Oh, and I'm using the [whitespace](https://github.com/lucaslew/whitespace) theme.
