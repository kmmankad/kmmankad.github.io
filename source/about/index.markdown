This is where I write something about myself. I'm a 20-something hardware/software geek. I love tinerking with everything from funky SDR antenna designs,low power embedded systems to massively parallel algorithms implemented in CUDA/OpenACC and Deep learning. I enjoy documenting my explorations and projects, and thats what this blog is mainly meant for. I'm an ASIC Verification Ninja at NVIDIA by day.

My github account is linked [here](https://github.com/kmmankad) and you can access my linkedin profile via [this link.](https://in.linkedin.com/in/kartik-mankad-ba3b9231). I'm always open to exciting opportunites and difficult problems that need solving.
